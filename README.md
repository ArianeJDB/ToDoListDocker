Hola!

This is my first fullstack project!

It's a To do list fullstack app with Docker and Docker-compose creating a Node-express container for the API, MongoDB container and NGINX container for static files.

This was my first time working with these technologies (NodeJS, MongoDb, Nginx, Docker) and I followed this tutorial to set it up: https://github.com/manufosela/introduccion-docker


APP IN PROGRESS!
